    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h3>Cookie</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon zest</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>        
    </ul>

    <h3>Icing</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 1/4 cups confectioners sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoons heavy cream, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <p>
                Beat butter and sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until 
                light and fluffy. Add in 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 1 tablespoon zest, and 1/2 
                teaspoon salt, and mix until incorporated. Add in 1 cup of flour, and mix just 
                until combined. Add in remaining flour, and mix until dough comes together.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <p>
                Turn dough out onto a lightly-floured surface and roll 1/4-inch thick with a 
                rolling pin. Cut out shapes using a 2-inch cookie cutter. Re-roll and cut 
                dough scraps as needed. Refrigerate cut cookies for 20 minutes before baking.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 3</h3>
            <p>
                Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line two baking sheets 
                with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Place cookies 1 inch apart on 
                prepared baking sheets.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 4</h3>
            <p>
                Bake in the preheated oven until cookies begin to turn golden brown on the 
                bottom, 12 to 17 minutes. Cool a few minutes on the baking sheets before 
                removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 5</h3>
            <p>
                Whisk powdered sugar, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon lemon zest, and 
                1 pinch salt together in a bowl until completely smooth. Add heavy cream to 
                thin icing if needed--or more powdered sugar if icing is too thin. Drizzle 
                over cooled cookies. Allow icing to set before serving.
